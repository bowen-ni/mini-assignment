1. Removing Missing Values:
   - Rows with missing values were removed to ensure data consistency.
   - This choice prevents biases or inaccuracies that could arise from incomplete data.

2. Removing Duplicate Rows:
   - Duplicate rows are removed to prevent over-representation of specific data points.

3. Handling Outliers:
   - Outliers in the price column were identified using the 3-standard-deviation rule.
   - Rows with prices outside this range were removed to maintain data integrity.
