# Activity 3: Math time

# Define mathvar1

# Calculate mathvar2
mathvar2=$((mathvar1 * 20))

# Define mathvar3

# Calculate mathvar4
mathvar4=$((mathvar1 * (mathvar2 + mathvar3)))

# Display the values of all variables
echo "Variable 1 is $mathvar1. Variable 2 is $mathvar2. Using $mathvar3 for Variable 3, our final Variable 4 is $mathvar4."

# Activity 4: More math - Working with floating-point solution

# Define a floating-point variable using bc with scale (number of decimal places)

# Display the value of the floating variable
echo "Our floating variable is $floating"
