1. Automated Tasks:
   - Daily File Cleanup: This job removes all files in the `test_dir` directory at 2:00 AM every day, helping to maintain a clean and organized environment.
   - Weekly Backup: A backup of the `test_dir` directory is created every Sunday at 3:00 AM and stored in the `backups` directory. This ensures the safety of important data.
   - Disk Usage Report: Every day at 8:30 AM, a report showing the current disk usage is emailed to bowen.ni@sjsu.com for monitoring purposes.

2. Additional Tasks Benefiting from Automation:
   - Rotating and archiving system logs regularly to manage disk space more efficiently.
   - Automatically restarting failed services to ensure system stability.

3. Potential Risks and Mitigation:
   - Risk of losing important data during backups: To address this, backups include timestamps in the filenames to prevent accidental overwrites.
   - Risk of high system resource usage or unexpected behavior: Thoroughly test cron jobs before deployment and monitor their impact on system performance.
